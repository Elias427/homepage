I am a 24 year old master's student in physics at Heidelberg University. Besides my studies I work as a Student Researcher in the X-Ray Imaging and Computed Tomography group at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg under supervision of Prof. Dr. Marc Kachelrie√ü with main focus on development of deep learning methods for CT and X-ray image data.

Currently I am writing my master's thesis as a visiting student researcher in the Wang Group at Stanford University under supervision of Dr. Adam Wang.
